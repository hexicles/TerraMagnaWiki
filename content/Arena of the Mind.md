## You have entered... the *Arena of the Mind!*
#### Welcome to hexicles' own little Zone of Truth and learn more about things yet to come!
Don't lose your way! Navigate within this page to: [[Arena of the Mind#Latest Update 8/24/2024|Latest Update]], [[Arena of the Mind#What I'm currently working on|What I'm currently working on:]], [[Arena of the Mind#Who, What, Why?|Who, What, Why?]]
##### Latest Update: 8/24/2024
Here's [[Story 2]]! Unlike [[Story 1]], I didn't know what was the point of it or how it was going to end. Just that I wanted it to be about *my favorite NPC,* Sinclaire. I think I really liked how it turned out, but my wife will probably strangle me for my horrible formatting. Sorry, dear, I'm just better at impersonating my characters than just writing about them in short story format.


###### What I'm currently working on:
Currently, not much. I finished Story 2 and now I'll probably work on drawing up some art for the characters. Don't expect some Da Vinci level stuff. Actually, Don't even expect me to come close to Ashe Corinthos' art either. I want my art to be simpler, at least then I'll feel like I can post it in some reasonable time frame. I've been working towards the finale of the campaign. I'm not sure how it'll change as the characters come closer and closer to it, but as it stands right now, I have *something!* Something that I think the players will like too.

Still in the pipeline: 
Flux Fighter! Fighter subclass with a theme of switching stances for different benefits. (i.e, being in flux. I'll think of a better name.) Inspired by Nioh and Tiger/Crane Style from Judgement.



###### Who, What, Why?
Who am I? I'm hexicles. I dabbled with D&D, as a DM, back in high school and then 7-8 years later, I'm at work and my co-worker, asked me if I wanted to play D&D, but he had no idea how to run a game. I offered to try something out with a few others and it quickly became a weekly thing that now swallows my free time, like a whale devouring krill. Outside of D&D, I enjoy cooking. I play boomer shooters, Roguelikes, ARPGs, SRPGs and occasionally, 4X. Inside my brain, rent free, lives the following, in no particular order: Dark Souls, Elden Ring, Fire Emblem, Bionicle, Yakuza/Like A Dragon, DOOM, Hades, Pyre, Bastion, EXAPUNKS, Touhou, and my wife.

What is this website? This website is dedicated to my RPG setting of Terra Magna. Inspired by some of the things that live in my brain rent free. I wanted to have a campaign that occurred somewhere weird, originally inspired by Fire Emblem, Yakuza, and Greek Mythology, but that quickly spiraled into a bigger and bigger project. Some of these names and people are more original than others, but for all intents and purposes, this is all parody and fanfiction. I sincerely appreciate all the 5 people I gather every Monday to roll dice and talk about my weird characters. If they or anyone else read this far, I truly value the space you occupy in my life.

Why? As a kid I made up all kinds of weird worlds and imaginary places I could lose myself in. I loved looking at game magazines and think about how cool it would be if I could be in all those beautiful and strange places, surrounded by all kinds of interesting people. (I couldn't afford a lot of those games so my imagination was the next best thing.) I loved playing pretend with my friends and imagining I was Toa Tahu, riding the waves of lava, or being Doomguy, mowing down hordes of demons. Growing up, nothing really changed, except now I imagine myself riding Torrent in Leyndell or fighting through Tartarus as Zagreus.
