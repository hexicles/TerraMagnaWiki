## The Lothran Calendar
Named after a scholar that brought the concept of tracking days from a far off land, The Lothran Calendar is the most common method used by humans in human cities. Other races have then adapted their calendars and festivals around the dates within the Lothran Calendar.

#### Month 1: Frigid
Winter is frigid indeed.

###### Deadwinter
Deadwinter is a festival to mark the midpoint of winter. It occurred on a special day between Frigid 30 and Knock 1. Amongst nobles and monarchs it is known as Midwinter and is traditionally used to make or renew alliances, although the common people called it Deadwinter Day, a reference to the cold and hard times that remained before the spring.

#### Month 2: Knock
Named after the sound heard by the doors kept closed because its still the depths of winter.

#### Month 3: Moth
Just as a moth emerges from its cocoon, the people leave the confines of their warm houses.

###### Vernal Equinox
Denotes the start of spring. Usually celebrated with partying as a way of finishing up the last of the winter's supplies. It occurs on Moth 19.

#### Month 4: Rose
Flowers bloom in the gentle grasp of spring.

###### Bluegrass
Bluegrass is a festival to welcome in the first day of spring. It occurred annually on a special day between Rose 30 and Heart 1. Traditionally, the wealthier people brought out flowers to give to the less wealthy, who either wore them or spread them on the ground to encourage the deities to usher in the summer.

#### Month 5: Heart
This is where the 'heart' of the year lives. Spring in full swing.

#### Month 6: Grail
Commoners would probably call this a cup. It's whats shared at dusk with friends in taverns and at dinner.

###### Summer Solstice
Denotes the start of summer. Spring crops are harvested around this time, and beer and wine fermenting since last years fall are now ready to enjoy. It always lands on Grail 20. The longest day of the year.

#### Month 7: Lantern
Like a small mote of flame in a lamp, summer begins.

###### Midsummerfeast
Midsummerfeast is a festival that celebrated love and music through feast. It occurred between Lantern 30 and Forge 1 on the Calendar of Lothran. It is a time when love advanced, and it is said the deities themselves took a hand to ensure good weather. If bad weather is experienced on this night it is considered an extremely bad omen.

###### Shieldmeet
Shieldmeet is the equivalent of a leap year day in The Lothran Calendar, occurring once every four years, adding a day after the festival of Midsummer and before Forge 1. Traditionally the day is used for fairs, bazaars, musical and theatrical performances, and tournaments of skill and magical ability. Nobles usually held court to hear the petitions of their people and to make or renew trade pacts, alliances, and agreements. Shieldmeet is known as <em>Cinnaelos'Cor </em>(also seen as <em>Cinnaeloscor</em>), "the Day of Corellon's Peace" in elvish.

#### Month 8: Forge
Much like its namesake, the heat of summer shapes the soft land with storms and rain.

#### Month 9: Nectar
Sweet summer fruit and the bounty of the land paves the path for the end of summer.

###### Autumn Equinox
Denotes the start of fall. One last harvest festival of the year. Families will often share the table with their neighbors and celebrate long into the night. It occurs on Nectar 21.

###### Highharvest
Highharvest is an annual festival, taking place between 30 Nectar and 1 Scale. It is traditionally a feast to celebrate the harvest and the abundance of food, but also the time when those wishing to travel left on their journeys before winter set in.

Preparations for the feast started as early as a tenday before, while preparing, cooking, and preserving the harvest for the cold winter months. Traditions varied from community to community, but examples of festive activity included food-related contests; races and challenges of skill and strength; receiving homemade sweets from the local clergy; and priests blessing larders, wine cellars, grain bins, and food preserves.

This day is often an important anniversary to various governments. Often, taxes and tithes came due, rulers held "open courts" to hear the concerns of their citizens, oaths were publicly renewed, troops received marching orders to new duty stations, and guilds met to confer on prices and rate changes for goods and services.

According to tradition, dwarves only drank water and elves drank only dew on this day. However, these traditions began to fade in the 12th century.

#### Month 10: Scale
As the balance of warmth and cold shifts like a scale, trade flourishes and both pantries and purses begin to fill.

#### Month 11: Edge
Leaves fall and blood spills on a knife's edge. The warmth dies.

###### Moonfeast
Moonfeast, is an annual festival, occurring between the final night of Edge and the first day of Moon. It is the last great festival of the calendar year.

The day traditionally marked the onset of winter. It is also a time to celebrate and honor the ancestors and the respected dead. On this day, folk blessed their ancestors' graves and performed the Ritual of Remembrance. People also gathered to tell stories of the deeds of their ancestors and of the gods until deep into the night, until they merged and became legend. This is a time to hear of past heroes, great treasures, and lost cities.

In Terra Magna, pitched battles were typically fought between harvest-time and the coming of winter. This meant that most of the fighting usually occurred in the month of Edge. The timing of Moonfeast after recently slain soldiers had joined the ranks of the dead is practical, if sadly ironic.

Heralds of Terra Magna had a number of special duties on the Moonfeast. Prime among these is to perform the Bloodsong ceremony, at which a Herald publicly recited the genealogies of each noble family in the area. In this way, the Heralds reaffirmed a noble family's traditional authority and status, as well as the respect accorded to them.

Priests of a number of deities of various pantheons held rites, ceremonies, and festivals on the Feast of the Moon. Many, though not all, focused on remembering the dead in one way or another.

#### Month 12: Moon
Much like the setting sun, the year draws to a close, and the moon marks ends and beginnings.

###### Winter Solstice
Denotes the start of Winter. Traditionally celebrated by going to the neighbors and sharing a fresh loaf of spiced bread on their porch and singing songs to the moon. The shortest night of the year. It occurs on Moon 20
