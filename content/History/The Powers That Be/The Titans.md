These beings were also once mortal, but overwhelming power turned them absolutely evil in every way. They commanded great power over their domains, but after being defeated by [[The Gods]], now they only watch from the constellations.

  

1. Duma, The Dweller in Darkness. A mastermind that relied on the inaction of good people against slowly rising evils. He masqueraded as a ruler figure to keep the people under his control. His domain is the dark and cruelty to the poorest.
    
2. Grima, The Fell Dragon. An evil force that spun plots to separate families and bring forth sacrifices to himself. They use human bonds against mortals and prey upon them. Their domain is despair and death.
    
3. Nashandra, Eater of Knowledge. She spread ignorance and disbelief to allow mortals to willingly give themselves up to her so she could destroy thought and free will, all that makes them mortal. Her domain is lies, deceit and falsehoods.
    
4. Mithrix, King of Nothing. He claimed to be from another plane of reality, a plane of absolute void and emptiness. His desire was to reduce the material plane to the void of his home. His domain is nihilism and apathy.
    
5. Vay Hek, Terror of the Plains. An absolutely awful conqueror of monstrous stature, he wished to have all of the world under his rule so he may only become bigger and more powerful. His domain is intolerance and greed.
    
6. Athetos. A mysterious figure that’s mostly unknown to mortals, they unleashed corruption and plague upon the planes. Their power rendered them able to bring incursions of monsters from other planes onto Terra Magna. Their domain is beings outside the material plane, illnesses and corruption.
    
7. Bloodless, The Red Maiden. She sought the one thing she lacked, the red life waters to prolong her devilish beauty. She lured mortals in with their vices and left them empty husks. Her domain is endless debauchery and inhibition.
    
8. Narmer, The Conqueror of Death. A peaceful death didn’t stop Narmer’s endless ambition. He created masks of undeath that refused to let the dead sleep. He created a kingdom of undead with him as their rightful ruler. His domain is undeath and endless ambitions.
    
9. The Rider in Red. Not much was left understood after The Three Dancers banished them. They would go from village to village, causing all inhabitants to dance forever until they collapsed from exhaustion. Their domain is dehumanization and the absence of the joy of life.
