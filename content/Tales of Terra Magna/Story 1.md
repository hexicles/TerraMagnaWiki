*Streaks of red cloud streams in the rain, painting a grim portrait. He wipes the blond bangs out of his face. Like a clown, his face colored in red and gray. His spear leaves a red trail in the dirt. He shuffles along as if nothing happened. He travels north.*

---

#### *Two individuals walk down a road.*
*One of them is familiar with the path ahead.*

"So... this really is your first time in the Kingdom?" The small-minded dragonborn chides.

The grey half-orc frowns. "I am well traveled... just within the northern jungles. As long as it amuses me, I will go see it. My brothers on the other hand, only seem interested in brothels and taverns." He sighs. 

A traveling merchant on a small wagon whistles to the two travelers. The green dragonborn whistles twice in response. The merchant carefully pulls off the road and throws a scroll at the dragonborn. A list of wares. A small exchange of silver for some dried meat, nuts and a few fresh fruits. The merchant doffs his hat, bows, and takes off.

Between bites of his apple, the dragonborn quips. "Are they really your brothers? I bet you get asked this question a lot. They don't seem to enjoy each others company and the way you travel separately it seems like you're hesitant to catch up with them."

#### *"It's complicated."*
"I tend to explain this often. We Half-orcs share our nomadic tribal nature with our orcish progenitors. When the Chief is ready to sire children, any healthy women not already married are required to become part of his harem. My *'brothers'* share the same father. Our Chief. My father is someone else. In that regard we're only half-brothers. In my mind, they're the ones tied down to their father. I'm simply not burdened with that responsibility." The half-orc laughs. He sweeps the blond hair away from his face. "I do not take any half measures. Half or not, we're still brothers, no?"
<br>The dragonborn smirks. "I see a little irony in that." They both laugh. 

"I didn't think the offspring of the Chief came in so many colors and sizes. It makes sense to me now." The dragonborn scratches his head. "Wait a spell... If the Chief has multiple wives...? Your father wasn't the Chief?...But then are they even your brothers at all?" He sighs. "And I thought dragonborn genealogy to be complex. Your family history puts nobles to shame." They both laugh again.

*A dull ache rings throughout the half-orc's mind. A thought crosses his mind. A winning hand of cards.*

#### *"We have reached King's Cross."*

The sun hangs low in the orange sky. The chatter of merchants and the footfalls of horses ring out in the small but busy crossing.

The dragonborn is now 20 feet ahead of the half-orc. "Are you well? You seem a bit sluggish." The dragonborn scans his companion. 
"I'm fine. A malady from birth left me with a sickness that is fleeting like the winds. It makes me slowly lose my senses of touch, taste and sight. I feel it come upon me soon." He uses his spear for support like a walking cane. "I have traveled with a few companions like you. It still makes me surprised how quickly they would offer their help knowing my relation to my brothers."
<br>The dragonborn opens a small ivory medicine case with a few paper wrapped boluses and offers it to the half-orc. "Dried Kafir root and mashed Blunda berry pits. One of these should provide a small jolt of energy. So we may setup camp soon. I predict you won't be in the mood for shopping anyways." The half-orc unwraps one lump and swallows it, then grimaces. The dragonborn laughs. "Cheer up, at least you still have your sense of taste."

*The half-orc's mind feels like a ringing bell. His left eye begins to cloud over. He feels the gaze of the dragonborn burn on his skin.*

They walk a mile off to a clearing. The half-orc lights a fire and the dragonborn clears the ground for the bedrolls. They sit by the fire as the sky darkens. The stars twinkle, like a choir. The dragonborn dresses up some small game and cooks it on a makeshift spit. "I appreciate the thought, I really do, but you mustn't baby me like this..." The half-orc grumbles. 

The dragonborn stokes the fire. "I come from a family of healers. Naturally I must look after others before I worry about myself." 

The bones, gnawed clean, crackle in the fire. A small flask is passed back and forth as a small leather cloth is laid on the dirt. "Feel well enough?" He brandishes a deck of cards.

#### A Game of Seasons.
"A full belly and a bit of Firewine could raise the dead to life. As my thanks, I will try not to wallop you the first few games." The dragonborn's eyes light up. He lays a deck of small wooden cards on the mat. Eight cards dealt to each players hand, eight lay face up on the mat. They take turns matching tiles of each suit.

"Say... Why come to the Kingdom at all? If you're just trailing behind your brothers and they only seem interested to see drinks and women, surely you could charter a boat to the Sultanate? There's plenty of scantily clad women in their... *'dancehalls'.*" The green one takes a red ribbon card. 
The half-orc stares at the cards in his hand. "I am not fond of their 'merry' brotherhood. I am content in the company of myself." The blond takes the butterflies.The dragonborn looks disappointed.

"But surely at some point, one of them turns around to look at you. What will you do then if they confront their stalker? What will *they* do when they find out it's *you?*"The dragonborn takes the Moon card.

"We do what we did in our childhood. We'll fight, argue, gnash our teeth and then vow to slit each others throats next time we meet. I wouldn't have survived this long if I didn't know how to deal with them. I reply with something along the lines of... 'The six of you couldn't slash your way out of a sheet of parchment if you had shears for hands.'" The half-orc wipes his brow. He leaves behind the Deer card.

*He stares at his cards. He's barely able to make out the flowers on them. The ones face up on the mat are almost indecipherable blobs. He feels his legs turn into mulch. He feels like his brain matter is oozing out of his skull into thin wiry blond hair.*

"Seems like a poor relationship between you and them." The dragonborn takes a swig from the flask and belches. "You know... You could always just leave them to their fates and travel on your own. I feel our paths diverge at the King's capital city." He matches the Deer card. The half-orc grumbles while the dragonborn chuckles. "I apologize if I have laid on my advice a little too thick." 

The half-orc takes a swig from the flask. "I haven't heard that one in a while. Thank you for bringing it back. I almost forgot that was a choice I had." He takes the Lightning card. 

The dragonborn, without missing a beat, takes the curtain card. "Three Lights!" They add up their hands and compare points. The dragonborn won. "I will not count this victory on my winning streak. I see no honor in winning against a sick man." 

"Oh that's good then, I shall not use my failing senses as an excuse tonight." The half-orc incredulously lays his hand down.

#### The constellations look down grimly.
"You are sure? I do not mind keeping watch while you take rest, lest your illness progresses."

The half-orc drinks from a waterskin. "I will be fine. 'This too shall pass.'" He chuckles wearily.

The half-orc watches the fire dance. His body feels like its made of stone, his bones of metal and his skin of leaves. His ration of dried meat feels like sand in his mouth and tastes like it too. A thought in his mind curdles and floats to the top.

*In a burning building, a green figure walks out, drenched in blood. His eyes the color of betrayal. In his hand, he wields a wavy sword, dripping red. A half-orc crawls out. Black hair, copper skin. The green scaled figure plunges the sword into the survivor. He draws a dagger and approaches suddenly.*

Everything lurches forward as the half-orc returns to reality. The glow of red embers lights an outline of his companion, resting. The blood drenched sword crosses his mind again. He closes his eyes and holds his head in his hands.

In the darkness at the edge of camp, the half-orc is hunched over. His dinner now returned to the forest. He coughs. A metallic taste lingers in his mouth. His blood feels like the foamy head of a beer. In his mind, one thought persists. Like a festering wound. It infects and swells. It oozes pus.

*It simply cannot come to pass.*

A grunt rings out in the darkness. A twig goes crunch. The dragonborn jolts awake and rubs his eyes. He cannot locate his companion. "Help me, my friend! I heard a noise and came to look but I fell to the ground and I cannot get back up!"

"I am coming!" The dragonborn runs towards the sound of his friend's voice. In the thick of the forest, it's difficult to see. The darkness doesn't help either. The half-orc reaches the tip of his spear by the dragonborn's foot in the darkness. The green scaled man cannot notice what is happening. The half-orc sweeps the dragonborn's feet with his spear, knocking him prone. Quickly trying to follow through with a decisive thrust, the dragonborn rolls out of the way and the spear hits a root. The dragonborn jumps to his feet and turns around to meet a dagger. A peal of thunder and lightning accentuates the last moments of the dragonborn as droplets of rain fall.

#### Red and green, Black Night and The Blond.

"It has to be me."

The half-orc helps himself to his former companion's items. The medicine box, the empty flask and the cards. The thought passes from his mind. He no longer sees the dripping sword. Now in his mind he only sees the clattering of copper coins on wood.
