Inside a small side office at the Grand Theater, a round man reads reports laid out in front of him and sighs, smoke billowing out from under his bushy mustache. He reaches for the well used drawer at his desk, and pulls out two glasses alongside a bottle of amber liquor. Thracian brandy. He fills up both glasses halfway and sets one glass in front of the thin man sitting across the table. An assistant is tending to the guest's wounds. The fat man puts out his cigar. 
<br>
"You know the rules. You, of all people." He pauses to take a swig. "You know what breaking them means to your organization, and our League." 
<br>
The other man gets comfortable in the chair. "I wouldn't break them if I couldn't take the penalties." The assistant finishes wrapping the bruises on his arm, and then exits the room. He continues without pause. "So I lost my temper. That's fine by me, but I have my reputation to uphold." 
<br>
The thin man makes a gesture as if he's holding a pen in his right hand. The fat man understands and opens another drawer at his table. He pulls out a box of cigars, these ones displaying a small red stripe spiraling around the cigar itself, denoting these to include a slower burning varietal of smokeleaf, Semlori Redchar.
<br>
"You remember the one I like!" The thin man selects a cigar and lights it on the burning candle. With his injured arm, he picks up the glass of brandy and takes a sip. "So... From the top?"
<br>

---

He drains his cup of coffee and places it next to his empty plate. "Say... What do you think they're up to now?" The notebook beside him begins to show these words. 
<br>
*I know they're fixing more problems they cause. I speak with the fallen sometimes and they talk of tension rising in the southern parts of the kingdom. There's always new problems to solve.*
<br>
He wipes his mouth with the provided rag, then wipes his hands. He reaches into his coin purse and leaves a few silver coins on the table. They move on their own as they get pushed towards him. 
<br>
"Again? You know I can pay for my own meals? Fine, I'll pay for someone else's. That table, there." He points to a small family of four eating nearby, oblivious to his presence. The notebook animates and words appear.
<br>
*Charity belongs at the temple. You're welcome to leave a few coins by Levon's icon of Bahamut. That does actually go towards feeding the poor. The kind of people that eat here can certainly pay their bill, just like you. But you count as family here, Sinclaire.*
<br>
With a drawn out sigh, he gets up from the empty bar and places the coins back in his purse. "Fine, I concede, Lif. I can't see your face, but I know you're smiling." 
<br>
The man puts his wide hat on, and stands up to walk out. The poltergeist flicks a spinning sign by the door that says 'Come again!'. As if on cue, a familiar face walks through the door. A reddish brown haired man with a thin mustache and chin patch, wearing a blue vest appears. 
<br>
"My Lord, Renaer Neverember!" Sinclaire exclaims with excess hyperbole, taking off his hat and bowing as his friend laughs and brings him back up for a hug. "How is rubbing elbows with the King, my friend?" 
<br>
"Ah well, you know, I was just there to discuss the future of the Kingdom before breakfast. Your Majesty says 'Hello!', by the way." 
<br>
They laugh and joke for a few minutes more. "Sinclaire, you must stop by for a drink tonight. It's rare for me to have the time to spend with my friends. I would invite everyone from *The Hand*, especially my red haired compatriot, but since they're out of town, I suppose you and I will be the only ones to enjoy all the lavish gifts of wines, meats and cheeses I keep getting from the nobles."

"How could I say no to the three main food groups! I'll certainly stop by with an appetite for a good party." They shake hands. "I have to return to the hall. Don't be a stranger! I'm no 'Lord' with an excess of lavish gifts, but I have room in my office for a friend anytime." They laugh and then part ways.
<br>

---

Muffled music swells from the theater's stage. The fat man laughs. "So that's what he's been up to these days. I do wish he would stop by sometime."
<br>
The thin man puffs his cigar. "You know, you could just come to his place after, right? That's where I'm going right after this."
<br>
The large man squirms in his chair. "After embarrassing myself like last time, I'm not sure if I trust you or my 'Lord' Renaer." He drinks from his glass. 
<br>
"Let me see if I can recall what happened last time... Oh! That's *right!* Someone forgot whether it was beer or firewine in his glass, chugged the entire thing, and then saw it come back up very quickly, all over Renaer's favorite rug." The smaller man cackles. 
<br>
The round man pinches his forehead to hide his eyes, but can't hide his wide grin. "Be quiet! I'll come by if you stop talking about my embarrassing moments, and continue talking about the subject of our meeting."

<br>
He has an uneventful walk back to the Guild Hall, but not before stopping by a nearby temple to Naga and scattering a handful coins in the donations box. The coins tumble down into an opening below. The notion is that a child in need could easily take coins if needed, but no self-respecting adult would stoop so low. A brief moment of silence as he wishes for safety to all children. He continues walking.
<br>
He turns the corner to see his Guild Hall's entrance surrounded by seven individuals wearing gaudy red clothing, heckling the people inside. Sinclaire quickly slides behind the corner to see what happens.
<br>
"Not a single one in there with the balls to come out and greet us! What's the matter? We just need to say hello to the boss!" The tallest one kicks on the door. "Unless your peacock of a boss is too chicken to step up to the Pyrehearts!"
<br>
*The Pyrehearts Guild.* Another martial arts guild, less focused on drills and practice, and more overwhelming force and strength. There is a long standing feud between the Pyrehearts and the Sword and Board. A difference of philosophy when it comes to martial arts are always a longstanding point of contention between guilds, but a rigorous system was developed to resolve these disputes.
<br>
The doors fling outward with a thunderous kick. Sinclaire stands behind a master craftsman, ready for an altercation. The tension hangs thick in the air. 
<br>
"My, my. Pyrehearts at my doorstep? To what do I owe the pleasure?"
<br>
The gaudiest-looking Pyreheart gets close to Sinclaire as his own craftsmen surround him in protection. The Pyreheart says "The Patriarch issues you a challenge. You know what that means."
<br>
"Challenge? Me? Boys, stand down." His craftsmen lower their guard. "Clear the arena. Pyrehearts, let's take this discussion inside."

---
<br>
The air is thick with smoke in the office. Candles and smokeleaf. Tense music rings out by the stage. The fat man wipes beads of sweat off his brow with the back of his hand. 
<br>
"If you'll permit me, I believe this would be your first mistake."
<br>
"What kind of host would I be, if we just had our little scuffle in the threshold? I'm sure the Pyrehearts would not like their reputation ruined for all to see." A smirk lights up the thin man's face, betraying that he wouldn't mind that one bit.
<br>
"This is what makes our organization so fractured. It is impossible for us to conduct our tasks with any decorum if we keep bickering among ourselves. I know the Pyrehearts might not be true members of our League, but their place in the city still makes their presence useful." The fat man chides. He interlocks his fingers and holds them up to his mustache. "What do you think *she* would have to say about this?"
<br>
The thin man's smirk disappears. 
<br>
"I'm sure she would understand. She *of all people* understands what I had to do. Isn't that the modus operandi of our League? *'Hide something by painting it red,'* she once told me. How else best to conduct our operations, than by masking it and then leaving it in plain sight? Let me tell you what I had *painted red* earlier."

<br>
Sinclaire wears his guild regalia, only reserved for special occasions and for times he may need to take to the arena. A thinly padded vest and trousers combo. The vest is a brilliant cyan, gold and white color scheme. It's said that in the Dahral family, these colors would better show the distinct color of the family blood. (The family blood is, by all accounts, red.) A thick collar protects his neck. Sinclaire leaves it unbuttoned to keep him cool. He wears a copper chain around his neck as well to promote heat circulation. The arms are traditionally uncovered to not hinder mobility; instead, a bronze bracer is worn on his right arm, lightly adorned with a chain motif of three different sizes, to represent the lines of journeymen, craftsmen and masters, literally upon their leader's right arm. Traditionally, craftsmen would not wear shoes upon the arena, but special light curled-toe shoes are part of the regalia.
<br>
The Guild of the Sword and Board is built in a traditional Centoese country house style. The arena is built on an unfloored room. A small, raised platform viewing area allows trainees to get a better observation of the action. Compacted dirt and dry clay mixed together make a tough floor that doesn't break as easily as wooden planks. Various practice weapons made of wood and adorned with wool cushions. Spears, Staves, Swords, Greatswords, Whips, Hammers, Axes and the quintessential Hinge-boards. 
<br>
"How brave of the Sword and Boards-man to wear his worship-day best! Too chicken to take us all on without your suit of armor? Or maybe you enjoy strutting about like a peacock?"
<br>
Sinclaire bites his tongue. "Hush now." 
<br>
He lights a stick of incense, and places it on the altar in the corner of the arena. An icon of a brass lotus sits in the altar. An Icon of Natah. Burning Sandalwood incense near an icon of Natah is said to devote the coming battle to her honor. Sinclaire places both palms of his hands together and closes his eyes. The rest of the Guild members in the room do the same. The Pyrehearts sheepishly follow suit.
<br>
Sinclaire turns around and extends both arms. His master craftsmen place a sword in his right hand. A wavy, dull, silver shortsword blade with a leaf-like tip. On his left arm, a large vambrace with a hinge to cover the entire arm while keeping mobility, a hinge-board of tempered steel furnished with gold foil. The weathering and scratch marks on the hinge-board leave only a small area around the edges with pristine gold. The scratch marks have small deposits of gold in it, resembling ichor. The Dahral family relics. Cobra and Crane.
<br>
This was the culmination of the Guild's fighting prowess. Sinclaire could probably wipe the floor with them using only practice weapons, but victory isn't the point. It wasn't the reason why the Pyrehearts' mercurial patriarch issued a challenge to the guild leader. This must have been a punishment for one of the Pyrehearts before him to face a decisive losing battle. Perhaps this is a slight on the mighty Sinclaire's honor to sully his precious time fighting these filthy bandits. Either way, this was going to be a very simple affair.
<br>
Two observers open their notebooks and with a striking blue glass pen, each begin to write down the details of each person in the arena.

---
<br>
Sounds of battle ring from the center stage. A powerful musical sting accentuate a decisive blow. The fat man reads from his notes. Apocryphal rules and points denote an objective way to score and adjudicate fights. To instigate a formal challenge in someone else's Guild, adds points to the Pyrehearts favor, to offset Sinclaire being able to prepare himself and his arena to his benefit. The number difference heavily favor the Pyrehearts, but the rank difference then evens out the score further. The thin man follows the fat man's eyes as he knows what's about to happen next.

---
<br>
Sinclaire seems to have held his own against the sevenfold assault. Each blow he would return tenfold. His silvered sword battering his enemies as he controls the fight with his left hand guard. Sinclaire holds control in the battlefield by keeping all his enemies to his left. But this was not to be such a simple fight. One of the Pyrehearts sneak up behind him and strike from his blind spot. This causes Sinclaire to break his guard and he loses control of the situation. The lead Pyreheart takes advantage of this and unleashes a fiery flurry of blows. Slowly the Pyrehearts wear his restraint down. All pretense of a fine display of skill gets thrown out, as these Pyrehearts are soon going to be.
<br>
The heat of the Pyrehearts fighting style is causing him to break into a sweat. He backs up into a defensive position and looks at the opponents in front of him. Only five remaining. He sticks his sword in the dirt floor. He quickly unbuckles his hinge-board. He unbuttons a few more in his vest to better cool himself down, after he destroys his enemies.
<br>
He assumes a different fighting stance. The air around him swirls into a cooling breeze. He punches forward, missing the Pyrehearts face by less than half an inch. The Pyreheart smirks as he sees an opening. His smirk is quickly wiped clean as a solid wall of air slams him to the floor. The very winds obey his command as skillfully as any weapon. Soon, Sinclaire was using his own hands to beat down his enemies, knowing they would anticipate his feints. In every case, Sinclaire with great ease, managed to knock down all his attackers until they'd yield. With a quick smash on the gong by one of his guildsmen, its sound declared the end of the battlle.
<br>

The fat man sighed and took off his glasses. He wiped great beads of sweat off his furrowed brow with a handkerchief and sighed. "Do I even have to explain? I know you understand exactly how this scores out."

"I can hear you say it in my mind already," the thin man mimicked the fat man's voice. "Use of non-martial effects to sway battle results in instant disqualification for someone of high rank." He sat up straight in his chair. 

"I cannot let the Pyrehearts win any challenge. *At any cost*."

The fat man's brow wrinkled even further. "You know what I have to do right? I have to report your disqualification, to *her.* You have to go explain this, to *her*. I tried to keep *her* away from you but report of this *will* find her. You'll have to explain your new ability to *her*." <br>
The thin man sighed and pressed his hands to his face. He tried his best to make good use of his newfound power, but instead he used it to maintain a decades old feud that he didn't start and he won't conclude. The respect of his people in his name mattered more than just 'winning.' He was fed up with it all. Now was the time for action. Sitting in this office and explaining himself was a waste of time. His 'punishment' would be a blessing in disguise.<br>
"*So be it* then! I have my honor to uphold. The legacy of my father rests squarely on my shoulders and *no matter what*, I must uphold it. To hell with the points and rules!" 

The thin man stood up, outraged. "For all the good our guilds have done for the people, this petty squabbling and rules system only hinders us. I understand we have these rules to show our recruits that one must always follow law, but what good does it do if those laws are only there to keep us fighting *each other*?" He leaned over the table, hands flat against the top. 

"My cause is just. A single unified Guild to keep the people in our benevolent hands. I'll tell Remi myself." He turned around and walked to the door.

"Sinclaire, wait!" Mirt yelps. 

He gets up from his chair with an unusual speed. He walks up to Sinclaire and places a hand on his shoulder. "I know you have a plan and big ambitions, but I had no idea you would go this far!" He speaks in quiet, panicked tones. "I fear you might have another war break out in the streets. You remember what happened to Black Chrysanthemum! If it wasn't for your friends driving them out, their infighting would consume the whole city! Would you have us do the same? My loyalty belongs to Remi, and she would never allow your presence in the League again! You would be a danger to her. and so you would be cast out. If you do so fighting, I may have to raise my hand against you..." Mirt looks devastated at the thought. "*Would you really have me do that?" 

Sinclaire turns to face his friend and gives him a hug, his arms barely reaching Mirt's back. "You are like a brother to me, Mirt. Sometimes my uncle, sometimes my father, but every time, you were there." 

He pulls away from his sweaty friend. "Something *has* to change. Black Chrysanthemum showed us that we are weak, but we can be better. Unless we put aside the decades-old rivalries, the inane code of *points* and *rules*, and gather up some *real* teamwork, all it will take is one more 'Dark Network' and 'Clover Family' to cause a full war to break out in the streets. The League of Guilds needs to have the foresight to avoid something like that happening. If it takes me being the sacrificial lamb to make that happen, I'll do it for the sake of our League." His eyes burn fierce with determination as his regalia billows in the cool breeze around him.

"We cannot rely on the Hand of Citrine to bail us out. We were only lucky they stood up to the challenge and stood strong in the face of the Dark Network, the Cassalanters, Clover Family, and more." He leans on the door. "I used my Ki against the Pyrehearts because I knew it was a surefire way to get the attention of our benevolent leader. Our City Watch and City Guard might deal with petty thieves and roving bandits, but if we are to ward off Titanic Cults, factions bent on taking the city for themselves, *and* try to keep the nobles from walking all over the people that keep this city alive at the same time... We *must* rally under a single banner." He opens the door and steps outside. 

"I'll see you at Renaer's party, Mirt." 

He shuts the door behind him, shutting the conversation down with a sense of finality.

Mirt walks back to his chair and sits down. He sighs and pours himself another glass of brandy, beginning to draft a memorandum about abolishing the points and rule system.

In the quiet parts of the city, Sinclaire approaches the gate of an estate. He waves to the gateman, and after a moment it opens for him to pass. This is the Ulbrinter estate home, belonging to a certain hermit-like sun elf. He walks up to the door, and they open for him, magic allowing him to pass. The house is very richly decorated and pristine in cleanliness, but not one single servant is heard or seen. The house is dimly lit, only the flickering orange glow of a fireplace is seen in a room past the grand stairs. A few continuous flame spells light the path for Sinclaire to follow. 

He enters the doorway and sees a red armchair facing the fireplace, alongside a small wheelchair. He can make out the silhouette of a blonde elf as the chair levitates and turns to face him. 

"Good evening, Sinclaire." 

Remalia Haligtree. Grand Instrument of The League of Guilds and Noble of the Haligtree elven family. She is tall and elegant, with long blonde hair, dressed in traditional matriarchal attire.

Sitting next to her is Sinclaire's father, Damien Dahral, also known as "Mad Dog Dahral", once known for his vicious, savage prowess in the fighting ring and on the battlefield. He swivels his wheelchair to face his son. 

"Hello, boy." He's covered in scars but his commanding atmosphere has never dwindled. His graying hair is slicked back, increasing the dignified aura. He wears a modest but faded formal attire. 

"Good evening Remi, hello Father." Sinclaire sits in the chair across from them. A breeze causes the flames in the fireplace to dance, and he unpleasantly recalls the argument the last time he sat in this chair.

"I trust you've been well, boy. Especially since you were feeling well enough to wallop those Pyreheart fools so well. In my regalia, too! I know what it took to make you come here. Have you thought about fulfilling your duty as I did, and as my father before me?"<br>
Remalia glances at the old man. "Damien! This has to be his choice alone. Last time we had this talk, Sinclaire left and wouldn't speak to us for *years!*" She says, hushed. "Sinclaire, I want to apologize for being too forward last time you came here, but-"

"It's alright, Remi, you don't have to apologize. Our tempers flared, and honestly, it should be *me* apologizing to *you*, Father." A pot of tea is lifted from the mantle above the fire, and it levitates over the cup closest to Sinclaire, filling it with perfect ease. Ticklemint tea. He hates ticklemint tea. He takes a sip anyway, to be polite. "I was a little naive those few years ago. I couldn't articulate what I wanted from accepting, and I didn't understand what the position would ask of me in return." He sets the cup down. "But I must ask, and please be frank with me; would I be given the power to change the League of Guilds how I see fit?"<br>
Remalia raises an eyebrow. "That *is* the position. You will have to be the hand that guides the reins."<br>
Damien loudly places his cup in its saucer. "What is your game, boy? What do you intend to do with this authority?"<br>
"Don't you worry, Father." Ink, quill and paper appears before him. The quill is made of phoenix down, it's fiery glow illuminating the paper. It reads to be a two page contract of succession, the position of Instrument to be passed down from Damien to Sinclaire. He signs the first page in his beautiful signature, the ink smoldering on the page as he writes with the quill. "With you and Remi as my witnesses, I've come to unify all the guilds under the League of Guilds. I seek to establish our power within the people we protect. I will abolish your rules and points, and squash all the infighting, bolstering ourselves for any threats to the people." He relinquishes his worn glass pen, his old status, and takes the new pen that floats from Damien's hand into Sinclaire's. Its beautiful design made of mysterious Xenoglass. It's coloration is threads of silver, gold and cyan through the body of the pen, and as the pen touches his fingers, a new color erupts. Crimson red. He signs the second page with his new pen. 

"I'll write in a new era of strength for those that rely on us."

"The nerve!" Damien scowls. "Who do you think put those rules there in the first place? It was *me!*" 

He watches his son stand up to leave, irritated. "Do you believe they will simply lie down and let you walk on them? Do you think to be Kruvalon himself, uniting the villages under his iron rule? How dare you destroy my work! Our differences made us *stronger!*" He shouts, and yet nobody listens.<br>
"Sorry, Father, but I have a party to attend to, so I leave you with this: Remi knows it in her heart of hearts that we've grown complacent in all the paperwork and espionage, and it falls on me to bring in a new generation of unity and duty, capable of fighting where king and country cannot." He stands in the entrance of the room and looks at the two, the howling winds follow him.

###### "The pen is worthless if we keep trying to throw ink at each other. We'll write in harmony before the year is over."

Sinclaire leaves, the door slamming shut behind him. The air is still. Damien barks and rambles on to nobody in particular, and Remi looks solemnly down at the paper in front of her. 

 "It feels like eternity since we were united. Such short sighted fools we were. We were wrong to think Sinclaire wasn't ready for the role of Instrument. *We were not ready for him to be a born leader.*"

Damien leans back in his wheelchair. His blood boiling. "Leading the League of Guilds is a heavy cross to bear. It's time for him to learn just how heavy."
