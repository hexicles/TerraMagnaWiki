Black Chrysanthemum: A faction of entrepreneurs and adventurers,  and to a lesser extent, spies and assassins, the same faction of assassins led by Rosaria. Their symbol is a Chrysanthemum that’s dripping in deep liquid. (blood or ink, depends on who you ask) Their faction support comes in the form of meetings with certain nobles and important people and loans at a reasonable interest rate.

#### The Stone of Golorr Gang War
Black Chrysanthemum fought the Clover family for control of the Stone of Golorr. A Black Chrysanthemum member was working with The Cassalanters, a noble family of moneylenders that secretly harbored a Titanic Cult. They wanted to seize the Stone of Golorr for their nefarious ways. A group of Black Chrysanthemum members, known as the White Owls, worked with a Black Chrysanthemum agent, [[Tsubaki Minekaga]], to destroy their operations in Oserith. [[The Puppeteer]] was the head of operations in Oserith. Tsubaki was their agent in the field, but [[Ren Kagane]] broke the mind control over Tsubaki, and she was free to destroy the one controlling her.
