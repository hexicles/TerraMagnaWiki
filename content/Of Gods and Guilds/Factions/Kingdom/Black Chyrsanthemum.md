Black Chrysanthemum: A faction of entrepreneurs and adventurers,  and to a lesser extent, spies and assassins, the same faction of assassins led by Rosaria. Their symbol is a Chrysanthemum that’s dripping in deep liquid. (blood or ink, depends on who you ask) Their faction support comes in the form of meetings with certain nobles and important people and loans at a reasonable interest rate.

#### The Stone of Golorr Gang War
Black Chrysanthemum fought the Clover family for control of the Stone of Golorr.
