League of Guilds: Altruistic Faction of Guildmasters that commune to keep the nobility in check. Craftsmen act as Guildmasters’ right hands and collect info for their guildmasters. Their icon is of a small guild hall. Earning the respect of Guildmasters allows faction members to get physical support from guild’s craftsmen and apprentices.
