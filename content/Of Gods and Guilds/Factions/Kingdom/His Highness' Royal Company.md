His Highness’ Royal Company: King Kruva’s private militia. A force of specialists to ‘take care’ of matters that threaten Oserith that the guards can’t deal with. They’re messy in their execution, effective on all accounts, that love their city and their king to the end. They bear the symbol of the King’s Ring. This faction’s high standing allows members to get away with certain petty crimes with only a minor penalty.
