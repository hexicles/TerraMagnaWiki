> *"I don't think this is where our story ends, my unfortunate friends. Some of you might not know me but you probably heard from our sentence: My name is Sinclaire Dahral. You deserve an explanation of why you're stuck in here with me but we don't really have the kind of free time to get into details. Lets discuss our options to get out."* - Sinclaire Dahral

Sinclaire Dahral is a human monk in his late twenties. He has milk-tea colored skin and long shaggy dark brown hair. He wears a blue shirt, black pants and a brown bear pelt cape. He wears a bronze chain necklace, polished copper bracelets and silver rings. He is a longtime ally of The Hand of Citrine and friend to [[Rytearius Gingerson]]. He has a calm, collected demeanor and talks and conducts himself with authority. He is kind to those less fortunate and looks down on nobles.

He was introduced to The Hand of Citrine during their escape from jail and helped the Hand lead a counterattack against Baron McKendrick. 
Sinclaire leads the Guild of the Sword and Board, a martial arts school dedicated to quick community action. A disease in his childhood lead him to be frail and weak growing up but his acerbic wit and cunning meant that when his father left the guild in his care, he made sure it flourished under his command.
In Baron McKendrick's hidden vault, a recipe for a "draught that could confer considerable power" was found, requiring Greater Albumen and Midnight Violets. After the Hand of Citrine found Midnight Violets, Rytearius brewed the draught with Sinclaire's help and they both drank the potion. Rytearius gained greater spell power from an unknown entity, meanwhile Sinclaire gained a kind of power ~~from within~~ **strength of the wind itself,** that waxes and wanes in waves of restraint and controlled fury.
During the gang war fought over the [[Stone of Golorr]], The Guild of the Sword and Board subtly kept tabs on the fighting and made sure civilians were removed from the scenes of battle.
Sinclaire is a member of the [[League of Guilds]] and key members of the guild help form the web of lookouts and agents of the League.
A regular at Trollskull Manor, Sinclaire helps take care of the Pigeon Tower and regularly writes to Rytearius on his travels and keeps him informed in the happenings in Oserith.
