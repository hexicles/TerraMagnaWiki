### The Right Path

At the tender age of five, Ren watched the world around him burn. 

The village his family grew up in, returned to the soil. His friends and loved ones, cut down in brutal acts of 'mercy'. The bandits and soldiers who tore them apart morphed before his very eyes, taking on a disgusting vermilion hue. He no longer saw them as people- only as useless, worthless garbage. A scourge upon humanity that had to be purged, no matter how it had to be done. The willingness to take life without care, to kill out of selfishness, dirtied the world. 

That only began to change when he met *her.* 

Her name was different then. He remembers that when she smiled, it made it seem like things would be okay. There were a lot of hard times, and during them they'd have each other. Her family was long dead too, and they only had each other to rely on- and for him, that was enough. The crimson shades of the world began to change, and he thought maybe it would finally be different. Maybe he could be happy, after everything that's happened. 

He was wrong. 

The neighboring dukedoms went to war, and just like that, he was ripped away from her. He thought that image of her would burn into his retinas forever, how he had tried to reach out and grab her hand as men began to drag him away, the shadowed figures pulling her into the darkness with them. They were both plucked from what home they had, and he never saw her again, and the memories were all but wiped from his mind, her smile never to be seen again. 

He trained, day in and day out. With nothing remaining but his desire for vengeance and his duty to uphold the law as he saw fit, he pushed himself to the limits his body could take, and then a little further. He quickly rose in ranks, becoming front lines to the White Owls as Black Chrysanthemum split apart. Even when he was captured and his left eye was replaced by a horrible, crimson variant, he promised himself he'd make up for it by slaying everyone who stood between him and order. He wanted to save lives and bring justice no matter the cost, and cleanse the continent of all who dared to sully it. Criminals met with the slick silver of his sword, and he never felt an ounce of regret cutting them down. With each one brought to their knees, it felt like he was one step closer to creating the world he'd dreamed of. 

Until one day, he saw *that woman.* 

It was as if evil incarnate had sprouted form. She was fast as the wind, gun drawn, a maniacal cackle following at her heels everywhere she went. He had never seen a person covered in so much blood before. She'd cut down thirty of his soldiers before turning on him, and when she finally spun around and met his one good blue eye with one that was that *dreaded vermilion color*, he knew what he had to do.

She smiled at him that day, showing off her teeth through the splatter of blood across the white gauze on her face, and it struck some kind of chord in him. Something telling him that no matter what he did, before he died, he had to end her. The world could never be clean if something *like that* still roamed it.

That day, and every one to follow, he would be haunted by that crimson iris. So much like his own, and so familiar, but filling him only with horror and hatred. She would go on to threaten him at every turn, to even target anyone close to him, and he would pursue her without rest.

If his fate were to end by taking her down, he would stop at absolutely nothing to kill her. If their destinies were to end in a blaze of gunfire and steel, he would do it. 

In order to walk down the right path, Ren would follow her right into Avernus itself.
