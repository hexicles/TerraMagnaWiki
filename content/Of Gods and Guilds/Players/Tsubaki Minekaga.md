### Blood and Violence

When Tsubaki was a child, her parents were killed, she was thrown into an unforgiving orphanage, and she was taken away from the only friend she had ever known. Raised in the midst of a crime organization that thrived off her strength, she grew to be one of the most feared assassins and hardened soldiers for a well known, nefarious, and sought after head of a criminal organizations. She has been trained through power and abuse to obey every order given, which has led her to have a long-standing feud with the one person in her life she can no longer remember her connection with. One the side of evil, and he on the side of good, they're fated to forever clash until one or the other dies. Relishing it, without any memory of what had once been, she lives her life seeking after the moment that he draws his last breath; or, when she herself can finally be free.
