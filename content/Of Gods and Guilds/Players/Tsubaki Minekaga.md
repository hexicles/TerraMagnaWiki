### What It Takes To Survive

Ripped from the cold and terrible orphanage she lived in as a lonely child, Tsubaki was torn from the only friend she had ever made, forced instead into a life of servitude to a terrible organization that changed her into a completely new person. Receiving abuse and bodily changes as they saw fit, put through gauntlets that threatened to take her life and then put back together again, over and over, she quickly became a prodigious assassin, rising to the top ranks of the nightmarish Dark Network, who made good use of her fighting prowess and her quick kills. Raised to be the pupil under an authoritarian seeking renown and power, she learned to love taking lives, to thrill within each splatter of blood. 

Yet, perhaps this was not who Tsubaki was meant to be.

### Ruthlessness Is Mercy

Tending to the fresh wounds littering her body, Tsubaki allowed herself to revel in the pain for a bit, making herself to numb to it. Things like this hardly fazed her anymore- a few new scars to add to the unending count along her back and arms. This time she had been hit along her upper arm and thigh, the blood seeping through the tainted bandages. 

Every day, always the same. 

Something to try out against her, treating her like a durable toy to test what they cook up out of sight. Spells, weapons, all of it- she's probably got a mark along her body to match each individual one. She can't remember the last time she had unblemished skin. 

Not that it would matter. A new battle would come, a new job to do, and she'd simply add to it again, like a morbid way to keep score. 

Most would find this a miserable way to live. For her, it's simply just the way it is. Even if she had any doubts, those thoughts would wash away just as quickly as they arrived. 

After fixing herself up in the sterile, clinic-like room she resided within, she began the short trek down the hall. After her run through the gauntlet today, one of the lackeys nearby had told her that the leader of the Dark Network wished to meet with her. Putting it off would be impossible. 

The leader... known only as the 'Puppeteer.' The idea of it sends a streak of ice through her veins. 

Even to someone as fearless as she, the creature that heads the Dark Network is far more than just a mere threatening individual. 

As she entered the chamber, the scent of flowers invaded her nose. Her expression contorted into one of distaste.

Approaching the raised platform at the other end of the room, she took a knee before the figure standing there, it's back turned to her. 

"I'm here."

It slowly moved to face her. The shimmering, black body vaguely shaped into that of a priest's robes, loomed over her. A startlingly white, cracked open mask stared down at her, emotionless, several faces layered upon each other giving it an eerie, surreal quality. The Puppeteer isn't named that for nothing. 

A similarly white flower adorned its center, faintly glowing upon it's body. It's obsession with flowers sickens her. 

It's the entire reason she's been forced to wear the large, deep red camellia pin on the top left side of her hair. Though, now it was as much a part of her as her favorite gun, really. It never came off. Ever. 

"Tsubaki," it said her name, in a reverberating voice that echoed its way off the misty walls around them somehow. "You are late."

She grimaced, head still tilted to the marble floor. 

"I'm sorry."

"You sustained injury today. I expect better of you."

"It won't happen again."

"An unneeded lie."

She grit her teeth, her fingers curling tight into a ball.\

A dark sleeve shot out from the Puppeteer to grab her chin, and forced her to look up. The hold was like iron, taut, finger-like tendrils hiding beneath the skin-like garb. The mask bent down to peer into her face, and she cringed away from the teeth hidden between the layers of masks. There are no eyes to glare into her, but the unending void within it is enough to send fear, the *only fear she's felt*, coursing through her. 

It's like peering into hell. Black, empty, lifeless. 

She could also feel the power emanating from its body. Unbridled strength and magical powers pouring out of it. 

Tsubaki had killed hundreds. She'd been in countless battles, covered in the blood of her enemies from head to toe, gun emptied of bullets and her melee weapon shattered with overuse. Never during those instances did she ever feel so helpless and uncertain. The Puppeteer, with a single movement of their form, could wipe her out in an second, and she would never stand a chance the way she was now.

Her hands were shaking. 

"I shall give you one more chance to redeem yourself. Otherwise I will be forced to punish you for failing me." The grip tightened painfully, as if to break the bones in her jaw. "Do not embarrass me."

She would nod, if not incapacitated. "Yes," she barely managed. 
\
"There is an old blacksmith I need disposed of," it said, the voice changing pitch ever-so-slightly. "Go to his workplace, kill him, and return to me with his head. You understand what to do."

She is released then, and she gasped in air she hadn't even realized she'd been holding. The looming figure took a step back, but continued to intimidate her with it's overarching height. 

"I will do as you say." It felt robotic, coming out of her mouth. 

As she pushed herself back to her feet, she brushed herself off, trying to seem nonchalant. 

"I expect excellent results, Tsubaki," the Puppeteer echoed, turning its back on her again. "I do not tolerate *failure*."

Knowing this was its way of dismissing her, Tsubaki turned away, still rattled. Would she never be able to stand up for herself against them? Its authority overpowered her every thought, as if dominating her psyche. Maybe one day she would be free. 

Until that day, well...

Her hand ghosted over her gun, lips in a taut line. 

She'll do as she's told, and her trail of bodies will precede her. 

Her ruthlessness will be mercy upon herself.
