copied directly from the character sheet sorry LOL

Pollie grew up as a only child in a small hamlet, near the northern mountains. Her parents, Illianna & Trobel, raised her in the typical halfling fashion, encouraging family, community, and curiousity. Pollie lived an enchanted life, until the summer of her 17th year, when bandits came in the dead of night to razed the hamlet in search of treasures. Pollie lost her two greatest treasures that day. Trobel and Illiana gave their lives to protect their neighbour's children Tomlain and Kalandra. Pollie escaped into the night with the halfling children, but come dawn the hamlet had been reduced to nothing but cinder, bones and ashes. Pollie journeyed with the children to a nearby village, using her small stature and nimble fingers to keep them fed, justifying the theft as, for the good of the children. She was eventually able to find a loving family to adopt Tomlin and Kalandra. Pollie herself would succumb to the innate wanderlust that grips most halflings, returning every year or so, to look in on the children, as they flourished in their new home. And always leaving a small pouch of coins to help with the children's upkeep. But despite ensuring Tomlin and Kalandra a second chance at a loving family, Pollie could not move past the death of her parents. Many a sleepless nights she spent, wandering to where ever her feet took her. One night, as she's cutting across the nicely manicure lawn of a manor, she can't help but notice an open window. Piqued by opportunity, Pollie scales the vine-draped wall, and drops quietly into a darkened library. A single candle is lit on the desk, resting beside it is a hefty novel entitled, 100 tips to better sleeping. Pollie's curiosity gets the best of her and she picks it up.
