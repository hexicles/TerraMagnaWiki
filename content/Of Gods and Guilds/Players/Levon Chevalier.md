#Levon_Chevalier

### "Neutral Good"

Long ago a paladin named Cheval met a red dragon named Malynda. They had 2 hatchlings. The first was a boy named Levon and 4 years later came a girl named Julliette. When Julliette was 2 years old Malynda left and Cheval raised his young. Then one day when Julliette became 6 years old Malynda returned. Malynda gave Cheval a choice. Give me the girl or you and Levon shall both die and I shall just take her. So Cheval had no other choice. After that Cheval started to train Levon in his way of the paladin. At 15 years old Levon became of age and his father was on his death bed. He told Levon find your sister and save her from your mother. So Levon set out. One day Levon heard rumors a white dragonborn sorcerer causing trouble in a town near the home where he once lived. He set out to investigate. And behold. He had found his sister. However she was evil and causing havoc. They battle and he tried to talk to her but she would not listen. And when he thought he was winning she had fled. Now 5 years later Levon was back on Julliette's trail. And he so happen to find her one more only this time she was much more powerful. They battled again and again he tried to talk to her and convince her there mother was the one she should be fighting not him. This time tho Julliette was winning. And she beat Levon. Rendering him unconscious. When Levon came to he found himself in prison for the crimes or killing a noble man.
