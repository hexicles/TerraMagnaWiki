### A series of Unfortunate Events

At the age of 12, my parents, Barbara and William Silverthorne, were forced by a bandit group, The Red Hands, to sell me into slavery or die. After some years of slavery, I escaped into the woods with the help of a bounty hunter, Jeffrey, and he trained me to be a ranger. Years of training and surviving with Jeffrey, the Red Hands attacked us, and Jeffrey was caught but ensured my escape. I got away and came across a mansion. I went into a room where I picked up a book, and a mist came out from the book and sucked me into the book.
