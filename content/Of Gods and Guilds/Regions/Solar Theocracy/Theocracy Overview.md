Eschewing both gods and titans entirely, these people worship the Sun. A community became a church, a church became a monastery and a monastery flourished into its own civilization. The people view their deity to be the giver of everything, and as such they work and toil to build great temples. They don’t normally respect hierarchy, but the Papi Luxa “rules” and his bishops take care of the people as much as possible. They’re mostly self sufficient conurbations. They don’t have a capital. The subjects live in somewhat poor conditions, but they’re happy and never hesitate to help a stranger.
