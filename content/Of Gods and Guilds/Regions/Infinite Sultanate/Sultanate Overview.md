A loose conglomeration of hunter tribes turned into a huge army. After a brief conquest of the western continent, they settled down into a republic of cities. Khans oversee their realms and the Sultan makes sure his subjects arenâ€™t scheming against him. The capital city is Al-Ruham and the subjects of the sultanate live in harmony with their fellows with a strong sense of pride in their community.
