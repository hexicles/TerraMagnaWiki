Magna’s Naturalists: Faction of druids and rangers that oversee the parks and the graveyards. They have a great interest in protecting the balance of nature and man at all costs. They’re not too present in Oserith, being a large city with not a lot of nature, but they’re spread out across Terra Magna. Their symbol is a leaf and a ladybug. Their support comes from information from their network and free food and care for animals of the faction members.
